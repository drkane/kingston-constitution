# Part 5e: A protocol for the relationship between the Leader of the Council and the Chief Executive

## Introduction

A successful working relationship between the Leader of the Council and the Chief
Executive (as Head of the Council’s Paid Service) is critical to the Council’s success,
the achievement of its policies and strategies, and its relationship with partners.

A mutual understanding of each other’s responsibilities, especially as incumbents
change, is key to the development of respect, tolerance and a shared appreciation of
the respective roles of the Leader and the Chief Executive, both individually and to
set the tone for good Member / employee relationships throughout the Authority.

The Leader and the Chief Executive subscribe to the general principles and policies
which underpin the high standards of behaviour and relationships necessary for the
Council to offer effective leadership in the community and fulfil its statutory functions.
In particular, these are set out in the Members’ Code of Conduct, the Employee
Code of Conduct and the Member / Officer Relationships Protocol, all of which are
contained in the Council’s Constitution.

All dealings between the Leader and the Chief Executive should be conducted with
mutual respect, trust, honesty and courtesy. Neither should place inappropriate
pressure on the other. In their dealings with each other, neither should do anything
that brings the Council into disrepute, causes any embarrassment either to
themselves or the Council, or leads to a breakdown in Member / employee relations.

In particular, the Leader and Chief Executive recognise –

- the need for a close working relationship
- the requirement for an understanding of each other’s roles and responsibilities
- the desirability of regular liaison through both formal and informal means
- the importance of effective communication
- a respect for each other’s views, advice, guidance and integrity
- the need for openness and mutual understanding
- the desirability of maintaining impartiality and independence of role
- the need to avoid bias and prejudice
- the need to demonstrate effective leadership and their responsibility to set an
example for others
- that any tensions that arise in their relationship need to be resolved swiftly and
amicably

In addition, they acknowledge –

- The Leader’s position as leader of the majority political party group
- The Chief Executive’s wider role to serve the Council and Members as a whole,
irrespective of political party.

The purpose of this Protocol is to ensure that the Leader and Chief Executive have a
shared understanding of their respective roles. To assist in that, these are
summarised below. This Protocol should also be read in conjunction with the more
general Member / Officer Relationships Protocol set out in Part 5C of the Council’s
Constitution.

## The Role of the Leader

The Leader of the Council is selected by the political group that has a majority of
seats on the Council and is appointed on a year by year basis.
The Leader of the Council is responsible for the overall political leadership and
strategic direction of the Council.

The Leader of the Council may appoint up to 10 Portfolio Holders, each of whom will
have oversight of a portfolio of service areas / activities. Subject to the formal
decision of the Council, Portfolio Holders shall be appointed Chairs of the relevant
Strategic Committees,.

The Chief Executive, as principal policy adviser, will ensure that the Leader and
Portfolio Holders are provided with the appropriate advice and information to enable
them to take informed decisions and they will have regard to such advice in reaching
their decisions.

As leader of a party political group, the Leader will not seek advice from the Chief
Executive in relation to party political business. Attendance by the Chief Executive,
or other officers of the Council, at political group meetings is, however, permissible in
the circumstances set out in the Member/Officer Relationships Protocol.

The Leader has no line management responsibilities for Council employees who are
responsible to the Council as a whole. Any concerns over the performance of
employees either individually or collectively will be referred by the Leader to the
Chief Executive to address. Matters relating to the appointment, dismissal and
disciplinary action in respect of employees are contained in the Procedural Standing
Orders set out in the Council’s Constitution.

## The Role of the Chief Executive

The Chief Executive has overall corporate management and strategic responsibility
for the Council and its delivery of services as defined in Article 12 of the Council’s
Constitution. The Chief Executive is responsible for the provision of professional and
impartial advice to all aspects of the decision making process and is accountable to
the Council for the implementation of strategies, policies and decisions.

As the Head of the Paid Service of the Council, the Chief Executive has certain
defined responsibilities under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to report
on –

- the coordination of the discharge of the Council’s functions
- the level, organisation, grades and management of employees required to
discharge those functions.

The Chief Executive is accountable to the Council as a whole. The post is politically
restricted in as much as the holder is not permitted to be an elected member of
another authority. While this does not prevent the Chief Executive from being a
member of a political party, it is recognised that this is inadvisable if the Chief
Executive is to maintain a politically impartial role in advising the Council. As such,
the Chief Executive is required to work effectively with all elected Members and to be
able to demonstrate political sensitivity and an ability to interpret political will.
