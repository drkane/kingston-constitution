# Part 5F - The Petition Scheme

The Council welcomes petitions from those who live, work, or study in the Royal Borough
of Kingston upon Thames. Petitions can be sent to: Democratic Support, 3rd Floor,
Guildhall, Kingston upon Thames, KT1 1EU.

Petitions can also be presented to a meeting of the Council, a Strategic Committee or a
Neighbourhood Committee. You can do this in person or ask a Councillor to do this for
you. Petitions can also collect signatures and be submitted through our e-petitions system
which can be found on the [Council’s website](https://www.kingston.gov.uk). We will also accept
petitions collected on third party websites provided that they meet the guidelines set out in
the section below.

## Guidelines

Petitions submitted to the Council must include:

- a clear short statement covering the subject of the petition. It should say what action
the petitioners wish the Council to take.
- the name, address and signature of each person supporting the petition.
- contact details for the petition organiser. This is the person we will contact to
explain how we will respond to the petition.

Petitions which are the same or similar to one already considered in the past 6 months, or
are considered to be vexatious, abusive or otherwise inappropriate will not be accepted.
The decision on this will be made by the Head of Corporate Governance. Examples of
inappropriate petitions would include those relating to matters which are part of ongoing
legal proceedings or those which target individual members of a community. In the period
immediately before an election or referendum, it may also be inappropriate to deal with
certain petition issues.

If a petition does not follow the guidelines set out above, the Council may decide not to do
anything further with it. In that case we will write to you to explain the reasons.

## Exclusions

There are some circumstances where petitions will not be dealt with under this Scheme.
These include any matters relating to Planning or Licensing applications. These will be
dealt with in accordance with the wider consultation processes and timetables relevant to
the specific application. For further information about making representations on Planning
or Licensing applications, please contact <development.management@kingston.gov.uk> or
<licensing@kingston.gov.uk>

Similarly, if you submit a statutory petition (for example one requesting a referendum on
having an elected mayor), or on a matter where there is already an existing right of appeal,
such as council tax banding and non-domestic rates, other procedures apply.

## What will the Council do when it receives my petition?

An acknowledgement will be sent to the petition organiser within ten working days of
receiving the petition. It will let them know what we plan to do with the petition and when
they can expect to hear from us again.

If we can do what your petition asks for, the acknowledgment may confirm that we have
taken the action requested and the petition will be closed. If the petition has enough
signatures to trigger a Council debate, or a senior officer giving evidence, then the
acknowledgement will confirm this and tell you when and where the meeting will take
place. If the petition needs more investigation, we will tell you the steps we plan to take.

## How will the Council respond to petitions?

Our response to a petition will depend on what the petition asks for but may include one or
more of the following:

- taking the action requested in the petition
- considering the petition at a Council, Strategic and/or Neighbourhood Committee
meeting
- holding an inquiry into the matter
- undertaking research into the matter
- holding a public meeting
- holding a consultation
- holding a meeting with petitioners
- writing to the petition organiser setting out our views about the request in the
petition
- in exceptional circumstances, writing to all those who signed the petition to clarify
any issues raised in or by the petition and/or to advise them of the outcome of the
petition process (normally the main point of contact will be the lead petitioner)

If your petition is about something over which the Council has no direct control, we will
consider making representations on behalf of the community to the relevant body. The
Council works with a large number of local partners and, where possible, will work with
these partners to respond to your petition.

The details of petitions with 100 or more valid signatures will be published on the Council’s
website.

## Petitions over 500 signatures

If a petition contains more than 500 signatures, it will be debated by the full Council unless
it is a petition asking for a senior Council officer to give evidence at a public meeting. The
Council will endeavour to consider the petition at its next meeting, although on some
occasions this may not be possible and consideration will then take place at the following
meeting.

The petition organiser will be given five minutes to present the petition at the meeting and
the petition will then be discussed by Councillors for a maximum of 30 minutes. The
Council will decide how to respond to the petition at this meeting. The petition organiser
will receive written confirmation of this decision.

## Holding an officer to account

Your petition may ask for a senior Council officer to give evidence at a public meeting
about something for which the officer is responsible as part of their role. If your petition
contains at least 500 signatures, the relevant senior officer may be called to give evidence
to the most appropriate Strategic Committee.

## E-Petitions

The council welcomes e-petitions which can be created and submitted through our
website. E-petitions must follow the same guidelines as paper petitions. When an epetition
has been created on the Council’s e-petition system, it will be published within 3
days of submission. This is because we have to check that the content of the petition is
suitable before it is made available for signature. E-petitions will be able to gather
signatures on the website for a period of the organisers choosing, up to a maximum of 6
months. After the closing date, the e-petition will be deemed to have been submitted to
the Council and the processes for consideration set out in the sections above will apply.

## How do I ‘sign’ an e-petition?

When you ‘sign’ an e-petition you will be asked to provide your name, your postcode and a
valid email address. When you have submitted this information, you will need to respond
to the confirmation email that is sent to the address that you have provided. People
visiting the e-petition will be able to see your name in the list of those who have signed the
petition but not your contact details.

## What can I do if I feel my petition has not been dealt with properly?

If you feel that we have not dealt with your petition properly, the petition organiser has the
right to request that the most appropriate Strategic Committee (or the Treasury Committee
in the event that the matter has already been considered by the relevant Strategic
Committee) reviews the steps that the Council has taken in response to your petition.

The Strategic Committee will aim to consider your request at its next meeting, although
this may not always be possible and it may have to wait until the next meeting. If the
Strategic Committee decides we have not dealt with your petition adequately, it may use
any of its powers to deal with the matter.

Once the appeal has been considered, the petition organiser will be informed of the results
within 5 working days.
