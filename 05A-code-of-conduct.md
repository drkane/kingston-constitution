## Councillor Recall Scheme

3. You are expected to abide by the obligations placed upon Members by
the Councillor Recall Scheme set out at Annex 1 to this Code which
provide a mechanism for electors to seek to recall a Councillor if they
are not properly representing local residents.

## Disclosable Pecuniary Interests

4. You must comply with the statutory requirements to register, disclose
and withdraw from participation in the discussion or vote in respect of
any matter in which you have a Disclosable Pecuniary Interest as
defined by the Localism Act 2011 and the Relevant Authorities
(Disclosable Pecuniary Interests) Regulations 2012 and as currently set
out at –Annex 2.

5. You must, within 28 days of taking office as a member or co-opted
member, notify the Council’s Monitoring Officer of any disclosable
pecuniary interest, where the pecuniary interest is yours, or that of a
“relevant person”, being your spouse’s or civil partner’s, or is the
pecuniary interest of somebody with whom you are living with as a
husband or wife, or as if you were civil partners.

6. If a disclosable pecuniary interest has not been entered onto the
authority’s register, then you must disclose the interest to any meeting
of the authority at which you are present, where you have a disclosable
interest in any matter being considered (unless the interest is a
‘sensitive interest’<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>

7. Following any disclosure of an interest not on the authority’s register or
the subject of pending notification, you must notify the monitoring officer
of the interest within 28 days beginning with the date of disclosure.
in which case you need not disclose the nature of
the interest).

8. Unless a dispensation has been granted, you may not participate in any
discussion of, vote on, or discharge any function related to any matter
in which you have a disclosable pecuniary interest. Additionally, you
must observe the restrictions the authority places on your involvement

Personal Interest) as defined by the authority.

## Other Personal Interests

9. In addition to the requirements of Paragraphs 3-7, if you attend a
meeting at which any item of business is to be considered and you are
aware that you have a Personal Interest in that item, you must make a
verbal declaration of the existence and nature of that interest at or
before the consideration of the item of business or as soon as the
interest becomes apparent. There may be exceptional circumstances
where the interest is such that participation in the matter might
reasonably be regarded as being contrary to the guiding principles of
the Code of Conduct set out in paragraphs 2.1-2.8. In this eventuality
you should consider whether it is appropriate to refrain from
participation in the relevant discussion and voting on the matter.

10. You have a Personal Interest in an item of business of your authority
where –

(i) a decision in relation to that business might reasonably be
regarded as affecting the well-being or financial standing of you or
a member of your family or a person with whom you have a close
association to a greater extent than it would affect the majority of
the Council Tax payers, ratepayers or inhabitants of the ward or
electoral area for which you have been elected or otherwise of the
authority’s administrative area, or

(ii) it relates to or is likely to affect any of the interests listed in the
Table to this Code, but in respect of a member of your family
(other than a “relevant person”) or a person with whom you have a
close association and that interest is not a disclosable pecuniary
interest.

Gifts and Hospitality

writing of any gift, benefit or hospitality with a value in excess of £100
which you have accepted as a member from any person or body other

authority having an interest, and the nature of the interest being such that the member or co-opted member,
and the authority’s monitoring officer, consider that disclosure of the details of the interest could lead to the
member or co-opted member, or a person connected with the member or co-opted member, being subject to
violence or intimidation._

## Annex 1 - Councillor Recall Scheme

### Introduction

1. The Council has introduced this scheme to give electors a mechanism to seek to
‘recall’ a local Councillor if they are not properly representing local residents.
Currently the scheme has no statutory basis but has been formally adopted by the
Council as an adjunct to the Member Code of Conduct. All serving Councillors at
the time the scheme is introduced (July 2015) and those subsequently elected to
the Council will be asked to confirm that they will abide by its provisions pending the
introduction of legislation to a similar effect.

### The Scheme

2. In the event of one or more of the following criteria being met:

    - (a) A Councillor’s attendance at meetings of the Council, a Committee or a SubCommittee
    of which they are a member over the whole of a Municipal year is
    less than 20% of those they were expected to attend at the point at which a
    petition is started;
    - (b) A Councillor has attended less than two Full Council meetings within a
    municipal year;
    - (c) A Councillor has attended less than two Neighbourhood Committee meetings
    within a municipal year;
    - (d) A Councillor has been convicted of a crime for which a prison sentence
    (whether suspended or not) has been imposed and the appeal period has
    expired without the sentence being overturned;
    - (e) A Councillor has moved their main place of residence outside of the Borough
    the Monitoring Officer, acting in consultation with the Independent Person
    appointed by the Council to advise on Code of Conduct matters, will consider the
    circumstances and determine whether an e-petition should be initiated on the
    Council’s website calling for the resignation of the Councillor concerned.

3. Before so doing, the Monitoring Officer shall notify the Councillor who has met one
or more of the foregoing criteria and give them the opportunity to make any
representations. Any such representations must be made within a period of 10
working days from the date of the Monitoring Officer’s notification. The Monitoring
Officer, again in consultation with the Independent Person, will consider any such
representations made and determine the course of action to be taken in accordance
with this scheme.

4. Where, having made any necessary enquiries, and having consulted with the
Independent Person, the Monitoring Officer is satisfied that there is a valid reason
(e.g illness) for the Councillor concerned having failed to meet one or more of
criteria (a), (b) or (c) above, or where the Member’s absence has been approved
by the Council itself, no further action shall be taken.

5. The Monitoring Officer will not normally be in a position to exercise any discretion in
relation to criteria (d) or (e) above, as they are both largely matters of fact.

6. Where the Monitoring Officer has decided that a petition shall be initiated on the
Council’s e-petition site, such a petition shall name the Councillor concerned, the
Ward they represent and the grounds under which the Monitoring Officer considers
the Recall Scheme has been ‘triggered’. It shall also set out the threshold in terms
of electorate numbers referred to in paragraph 8 below for that particular Ward.

7. Once initiated, the petition will be live on the Council’s website to collect signatures
for a period of three calendar months or when the electoral threshold is reached,
whichever is the sooner.

8. Where, at the end of the three month period, or sooner, a number of registered local
government electors equivalent to at least 33% (the threshold figure) of the total
number of electors registered in the Ward on the first day of the month in which the
petition was launched have validly subscribed to the petition, the Councillor who is
the subject of the petition will be advised of the fact by the Monitoring Officer and
asked to consider, in accordance with the terms of this scheme, resigning from the
Council.

9. Where a Councillor resigns in accordance with this scheme, the Council’s Returning
Officer shall call a By-Election to fill the resultant vacancy in accordance with the
usual statutory timescales, unless the vacancy occurs within six months of the next
scheduled four yearly Council Elections.

10. The Councillor concerned may stand in that By-Election if they so choose.

11. Should a Councillor decide not to stand down, the circumstances of the case shall
be referred to the Audit, Governance and Standards Committee for consideration
and to determine whether any further action should be considered.

12. The Audit, Governance and Standards Committee shall have overall responsibility
for the operation of this scheme and shall receive an annual report on its operation.

13. Nothing in this scheme shall detract from the statutory provisions relating to the
disqualification of serving Councillors under the Local Government Act, 1972 (as
amended) or the Representation of the People Act 1983 (as amended) or the
provisions of the Council’s Member Code of Conduct relating to the Declaration of
Pecuniary Interests.

14. The provisions of this scheme shall not apply in circumstances where any ByElection
triggered as a result of this scheme would otherwise have taken place in
the 6 month period leading up to the four yearly Council elections.
