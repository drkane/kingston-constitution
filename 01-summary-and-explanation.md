# Part 1 - Summary and Explanation

## The Council’s Constitution
The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames constitution sets out how the Council
operates, how decisions are made and the procedures which are followed to ensure that
these are efficient, transparent and accountable to local people. Some of these processes
are required by law, while others are a matter for the Council to choose.

The Constitution is divided into 16 articles which set out the basic rules governing the
Council’s business. More detailed procedures and codes of practice are provided in
separate rules and protocols at the end of the document.

## How the Council operates

The Council is composed of 48 Councillors who are elected every four years representing
16 electoral Wards. Councillors are democratically accountable to residents of their ward.
The overriding duty of Councillors is to the whole community, but they have a special duty
to their constituents, including those who did not vote for them.

Councillors have to agree to follow a code of conduct to ensure high standards in the way
they undertake their duties. The Audit, Governance and Standards Committee trains and
advises them on the code of conduct.

All Councillors meet together as the Council. Meetings of the Council are normally open to
the public. This is where Councillors decide the Council’s overall policies and set the
budget each year. The Council appoints the Councillors to serve on the various
Committees and other bodies and can hold them to account for the decisions that they
take. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings to listen to the
debates and are able to present petitions and form deputations to address the Council on
matters of interest or concern to them.

## How decisions are made

The Council has a structure of Committees which are responsible for most day-to-day
decisions and on which Councillors serve. Meetings of the Committees and other bodies
are generally open to the public except where “exempt” (e.g. personal) or confidential
matters, as defined by the Access to Information legislation, are being discussed.

## Scrutiny

There is a Health Overview Panel which can make reports and recommendations to the
Council and also to NHS bodies on the outcome of scrutiny exercises.

## Neighbourhood Committees

In order to give local citizens a greater say in Council affairs, four Neighbourhood
Committees have been created. These Committees are responsible for a range of
decisions that are best made at a local level. Meetings are usually held in the area of the
neighbourhood so that more local people can attend. Each covers three, four or five
electoral wards and the Councillors representing those wards serve on the Committees.
Details of their functions are referred to in Article 10 of the Constitution.

## The Council’s Staff

The Council has people working for it (called ‘officers’) to give advice, implement decisions
and manage the day-to-day delivery of its services. Some officers have a specific duty to
ensure that the Council acts within the law and uses its resources wisely. A Code of
Conduct governs the relationships between officers and members of the Council.

## Citizens’ Rights

Citizens have a number of rights in their dealings with the Council. These are set out in
more detail in Article 3. Some of these are legal rights, whilst others depend on the
Council’s own processes. The local Citizens’ Advice Bureau can advise on individuals’
legal rights.

Where members of the public use specific Council services, for example as a parent of a
school pupil or as a Council tenant, they have additional rights. These are not covered in
this Constitution.

Citizens have the right to:

- vote at local elections if they are registered;
- contact their local Councillor about any matters of concern to them;
- obtain a copy of the Constitution;
- attend meetings of the Council, its Committees and Panels except where, for example,
  “exempt” (e.g. personal) or confidential matters, as defined by the Access to
  Information legislation, are being discussed;
- petition to request a referendum on a mayoral form of executive;
- ask questions at most meetings and, within the rules laid down by the body concerned,
  contribute to debates on individual items;
- present petitions at Council meetings and, if they wish, speak on those petitions;
- seek a review of Council decisions through the Community Call-In process (subject to a
  minimum of 100 signatures)
- form deputations to present their views at Council and certain other meetings;
- participate in the annual State of the Borough debate and contribute to the identification
  of topics for ‘community debates’ at meetings of Council
- find out, from the Forward Plan, what major decisions are to be discussed;
- see reports and background papers, and any record of decisions made by the Council,
  its Committees, and other decision making bodies (except where ‘exempt’ or
  confidential information would be disclosed);
- complain to the Council about something that has gone wrong or compliment the
  Council or comment on services;
- complain to the Ombudsman if they think the Council has not followed its procedures
  properly. However, they should only do this after using the Council’s own complaints
  process;
- inspect the Council’s accounts and make their views known to the external auditor.

The Council welcomes participation by its citizens in its work.
